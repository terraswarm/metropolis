mgdb - The metamodel debugger for the systemc backend.

mgdb is a debugger for executable simulations built with the systemc
backend.  It is Gnu's "gdb" debugger with custom commands that make use
of special code added to the C++ code generated by the systemc backend. 
It allows debugging the metamodel (.mmm) source code directly.

It's arguable whether it can be said that there is debugging backend, per
se.  It might be more fair to say that the systemc backend has a
debugging mode.  To prepare a metamodel simulation for debugging, one
actually runs the systemc backend, passing an extra argument of
"-mmdebug".  This causes the systemc backend to add extra code to the
simulation to provide mgdb with the .mmm source code line information it
needs to debug .mmm source code.  

mgdb has a user's guide, which describes how build a simulation for
debugging and how to use the debugger itself.  That guide can be
found in $METRO/util/mgdb in both HTML format and plain text:
    $METRO/util/mgdb/mgdb_user_guide.htm, and
    $METRO/util/mgdb/mgdb_user_guide.txt.
