<body>
Utilities for the Elaborator backend.
<p>
Most of these classes are reimplementations of the corresponding
classes in the java.util package except that 
Objects of these classes that have equal elements are not themselves equal.

 <br>This differs from the corresponding classes in java.util, where the
corresponding classes in java.util that have equal elements are
themselves equal.
