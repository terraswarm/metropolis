Syntax Highlighter for vim

mmm.vim:
Here is a syntax highlighting file that I created for working with Metropolis Meta Model Files. It works with vim (and probably vi). All you have to do is put this file in your /usr/share/vim/syntax directory (or wherever your syntax directory is for vim.


java.vim
I have included this since mmm.vim builds upon it. If you do not already have a syntax highlighter for java with your vim distribution then also add this to the syntax directory.


Feel free to modify the highlighter for your own personal preference or e-mail me with suggestion for color changes or adding additional recognized keywords.
