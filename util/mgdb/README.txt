This directory contains files related to the metamodel debugger,
$METRO/bin/mgdb.

The debugger takes two forms: mgdb, which looks like & uses gdb,
and mddd, which looks like & uses ddd.  Both these executables are
intended to be run from $METRO/bin.  mddd exists only as a symbolic
link to mgdb in $METRO/bin.

The documentation for mgdb resides in this directory:
mgdb_user_guide.htm is a user guide in HTML format, and
mgdb_user_guide.txt is the same information in plain text.
