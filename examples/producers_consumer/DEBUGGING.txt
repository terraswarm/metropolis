To build the example code for metamodel debugging:

% make MMDEBUG=-mmdebug

-----

This has the following effects:

- Preprocessor directives "#line <n> <.mmm file name>" are added to the
    generated .cpp code.

- For each generated blah.cpp file:
    - Rename blah.cpp to blah.cpp.bak
    - Copy blah.mmm to blah.cpp
This causes gdb to use the metamodel code as the source code for debugging.

-----

The following changes were made to the metropolis code to provide this
capability:

- New class metropolis.metamodel.backends.systemc.LineList
    (originally written by Daniele Gasperini).

- In SystemCCodegenVisitor.java, all instances of 
    LinkedList retlist = new LinkedList();
  changed to 
    LineList retlist = new LineList(node, emittingLineDirectives);
  where the second argument is a boolean to turn on the output of
  "#line" preprocessor directives to the generated .cpp code.

- Fix $METRO/metropolis/metamodel/frontend/parser/Grammar.y to keep track
  of line numbers at multiple levels of the parse tree.

- Add -mmdebug option to $METRO/bin/systemc
